# ElectricSchematic

A simple tool for simulating electronic Circuits. Made using JavaFX. 

#### Components
It can model circuits that contain batteries, lamps and resistors.  There is also limited support for some combinations of these components in parrallel.
Each component can be edited by right-clicking on it and adjusting the slider value for resistance or voltage.

#### Circuits
Components can be connected by dragging from an anchor to another to form a circuit.
The circuit can then be analysed with the ammeter and voltmeter tool to get the voltage and current at different points in the curcuit by clicking on _Evaluate_.

##Usage

Simply git clone the repositoty then import this project into your favourite IDE and run the Application/main. 
Schematics are saved and loaded as JSON. You can find some example files in the data folder.
