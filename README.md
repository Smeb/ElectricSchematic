# ElectricSchematic

A simple tool for simulating electronic Circuits. Made using JavaFX. 

It can model circuits that contain Batteries, lamps and resistors. There is also limited support for some combinations of these components in parrallel.
The circuit can then be analysed with the ammeter and voltmeter tool to get the voltage and current at different points in the curcuit. 

##Usage

Simply git clone the repoiroty then import this project into your favourite IDE and run the Application/main. 
Schematics are saved and loaded as JSON. You can find some example files in the data folder.
